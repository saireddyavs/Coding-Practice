Given two distinct words start and target, and a set denoting a dictionary of unique words of equal lengths. Find the length of the shortest transformation sequence from start to target.
Keep the following conditions in mind:

    A word can only consist of lowercase characters.
    Only one letter can be changed in each transformation.
    Each transformed word must exist in the dictionary. 
    The starting word may not exist in the dictionary.
    Target will always be in the dictionary otherwise the path is not possible and you should return 0.
